# Software Design Patterns

This is a comprehensive guide to software design patterns. It provides an overview of various design patterns, their purpose, implementation details, and use cases.

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They represent best practices and can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

Understanding these patterns can help you write more efficient, maintainable, and scalable code. They can also improve your problem-solving skills and make it easier to communicate with other developers.

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about design patterns or an experienced developer seeking a refresher, this guide can be a valuable resource.

Happy coding!

1. [Singleton Pattern](./examples/singleton)

   - **Purpose:** The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the application and provides a global point of access to it. This is particularly useful when a single object is required to coordinate actions across the system.
   - **Implementation Details:**
     - **Private Constructor:** Prevents direct instantiation of the class from outside.
     - **Static Instance:** Holds a static reference to the single instance of the class.
     - **Lazy Initialization:** Creates the instance only when required.
     - **Thread-Safe Access:** Uses synchronization or other mechanisms to ensure thread safety.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - **Logging:** Global access to the same logging instance.
     - **Configuration Management:** Access to a single source of configuration.
     - **Shared Resources:** Database connection pools, caches, etc.
   - [**See examples**](./examples/singleton)

2. [Factory Pattern](./examples/factory)

   - **Purpose:** The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This is useful when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it needs to create.
   - **Implementation Details:**
     - **Factory Interface:** Defines a method for object creation.
     - **Concrete Factories:** Implement the interface and return different object types.
     - **Client Code:** Uses the factory interface to create objects.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - **UI Component Creation:** Creating different types of UI components dynamically.
     - **Database Access:** Generating different database connections.
     - **Document Parsing:** Handling various document formats (e.g., XML, JSON).
   - [**See examples**](./examples/factory)

3. [Observer Pattern](./examples/observer)

   - **Purpose:** The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This is useful when the change of a state in one object must be reflected in other objects without keeping the objects tightly coupled.
   - **Implementation Details:**
     - **Subject Interface:** Maintains a list of observers and provides methods for adding and removing observers.
     - **Observer Interface:** Defines an update method that is called when the subject's state changes.
     - **Concrete Subject:** Implements the subject interface and notifies observers upon state change.
     - **Concrete Observers:** Implement the observer interface and update themselves based on the subject's state.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - **Event Handling Systems:** User interface events (e.g., button clicks).
     - **Reactive Programming:** Observing changes in data streams.
     - **Messaging Systems:** Notifications about new messages or alerts.
   - [**See examples**](./examples/observer)

4. [Strategy Pattern](./examples/strategy)

   - **Purpose:** The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it. This is useful when there are several ways of doing something and the choice of which way to do it is to be made at runtime.
   - **Implementation Details:**
     - **Strategy Interface:** Defines a common interface for algorithms.
     - **Concrete Strategies:** Implement the strategy interface and provide specific algorithms.
     - **Context Class:** Maintains a reference to a strategy and allows changing strategies dynamically.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - **Payment Processing:** Switching between different payment methods.
     - **Sorting Algorithms:** Choosing different sorting algorithms based on data size.
     - **Compression Strategies:** Switching between various file compression techniques.
   - [**See examples**](./examples/strategy)

5. [Decorator Pattern](./examples/decorator)

   - **Purpose:** The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. This is useful when you want to add responsibilities to individual objects, not to an entire class.
   - **Implementation Details:**
     - **Component Interface:** Defines a common interface for objects.
     - **Concrete Component:** Implements the component interface with core functionality.
     - **Decorator Class:** Wraps the component interface and adds new behavior.
     - **Concrete Decorators:** Extend the decorator class to add specific behavior.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - **UI Components:** Adding features like borders or scroll bars to UI components.
     - **Stream Handling:** Adding features like buffering or encryption to data streams.
     - **Notification Systems:** Combining email, SMS, and push notifications.
   - [**See examples**](./examples/decorator)

6. [Adapter Pattern](./examples/adapter)

   - **Purpose:** The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. This is useful when you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
   - **Implementation Details:**
     - **Target Interface:** Defines the expected interface for the client.
     - **Adaptee Class:** Implements a different interface that needs adaptation.
     - **Adapter Class:** Implements the target interface and translates client requests to the adaptee.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - **Legacy System Integration:** Connecting new software with older systems.
     - **Third-Party Libraries:** Making incompatible external libraries usable.
     - **UI Frameworks:** Integrating new UI components with existing frameworks.
   - [**See examples**](./examples/adapter)

7. [Builder Pattern](./examples/builder)
   - **Purpose:** The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. This is useful when you need to construct a complex object step by step and you want to avoid a 'telescopic constructor' scenario.
   - **Implementation Details:**
     - **Builder Interface:** Defines methods for building object components.
     - **Concrete Builders:** Implement the builder interface and provide specific implementations.
     - **Director Class:** Defines the order in which to build components.
     - **Product Class:** Represents the final complex object.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - **UI Forms:** Building UI forms with different fields and validation rules.
     - **Complex Objects:** Creating complex object structures (e.g., house, car).
     - **Database Queries:** Constructing complex database queries.
   - [**See examples**](./examples/builder)
